**Webpack + React + ESLint boilerplate for your next project.**

This is a basic boilerplate for a react project. 
It has some features you most likely will need in your next react project, like:
- webpack config;
- airbnb style eslint config (.eslintrc file);
- editor config (.editorconfig file);
- browserlist config (.browserlistrc file);
- babel config (.babelrc file)

**Webpack config**

Webpack config is separated to 3 files: 
1 common file and 2 files for development and production environments.
