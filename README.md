**Webpack + React + Babel + ESLint boilerplate for your next project.**

This is a basic boilerplate for a react project. 
It has some features you most likely will need in your next react project, like:
- webpack config;
- airbnb style eslint config (.eslintrc file);
- editor config (.editorconfig file);
- browserlist config (.browserlistrc file);
- babel config (.babelrc file)

**Webpack config**

Webpack config is separated to 3 files: 
1 common file and 2 files for development and production environments.

**Preinstalled packages**

There are some preinstalled packages that you might probably need. 
Feel free to `npm remove` them all tough if you don't need any of this). 
Some obvious choices like redux and react-router are not listed:
 
- ramda to make your code more functional
- immer to deal with deeply nested state values
- react-fast-compare to compare your props really fast ))
- memoize-one to memoize your filtered and mapped props in mapStateToProps
- date-fns, moment.js alternative
- polished to do some CSS-in-JS stuff
- loglevel to log application messages
- react-interval-timer to set some timers in your app
- react-onclickoutside to listen on clicks outside your component
